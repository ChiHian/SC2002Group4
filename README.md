# Welcome to MOBLIMA!

## Setup

In order to setup our app:

1. `git clone https://github.com/aryans1204/MOBLIMA.git`
2. Navigate to the MOBLIMA project directory `cd MOBLIMA`
3. Run our JAR package to build the app from the root directory `java -jar ./build/MOBLIMA.jar`

This will startup our main App.


The docs are provided under `/docs`

In order to build the Javadocs:

Run `javadoc -d ./docs ./src/controllers/*java ./src/entities/*java ./src/boundaries/*java ./src/*java`

Additionally, the Javadocs are deployed via github-pages under the environment.
